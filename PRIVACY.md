# Privacy Policy - Multi-Lingual Input Tools

## Collected Data

### What data is collected?
NONE of your personal data is ever collected or stored.
The only collected data are the following (both of which the user must set manually):
- Color Mode Preference (Light/Dark)
- Selected Language

### What we do with collected data
With the Color Mode, we change the background and text color of all pages of the extension to match to the set preference.
With the Language preference we show different buttons (for copying and pasting letters and symbols) in the popup and in the Full Typing Area (FTA).
We process all button and link clicks within the extension. We do not process links that lead to external sites. 
We do not store button or link clicks, only process them.
We also do NOT profile users in anyway.

### Data Turnover/Deletion
Since all of the stored data is stored with the help of [Chrome Sync](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/storage/) and not on a database, we can not delete or turn over any data to you.

## Trackers
This extension does NOT track or profile users in anyway.

## Advertisements
This extension does NOT display advertisements.<br>
This extension does NOT target users in anyway.
